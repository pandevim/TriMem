## Overview

**SOP-Bench** is a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating LLM-based agents on complex, multi-step Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) that are fundamental to industrial automation. Built from 2,000+ tasks across 12 industrial domains (healthcare, logistics, finance, content moderation, etc.), SOP-Bench addresses the gap between existing benchmarks and real-world procedural complexity.

## The Problem

Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) are the backbone of industrial operations—from content moderation to healthcare intake to supply chain logistics. These multi-step procedures require:

- **Sequential reasoning** across 10-50+ decision points
- **Tool orchestration** to gather information from multiple systems  
- **Implicit knowledge** that humans learn but rarely document
- **Ambiguity handling** when procedures don't cover edge cases

**Can LLM agents reliably execute these procedures?**

Our research shows they struggle significantly—with performance varying dramatically across domains (26.7%-94.3% success rates).

---

## Key Findings

📊 **Detailed leaderboard and benchmark results coming soon.**

Early findings from our evaluation of 11 frontier models:

- **Function-Calling agents**: ~64% average task success rate
- **ReAct agents**: ~55% average task success rate  
- **High execution rates (95%+)** indicate failures are reasoning-based, not technical
- **Open-source models** (DeepSeek-R1, Llama 3.3) approach proprietary performance
- **Architecture-model co-design matters**: Newer reasoning models can degrade ReAct performance without targeted prompt engineering

## Example: What Does an SOP Task Look Like?

Here's a simplified example from the **Dangerous Goods** benchmark:

**SOP Instruction (excerpt):**

> _"1. Retrieve the Safety Data Sheet for the product. 2. Check if the product contains any Class 3 flammable liquids. 3. If flash point < 23°C, classify as Packing Group I..."_

**Task Input:**

```json
{
  "product_id": "CHEM-2847",
  "shipment_type": "air_freight"
}
```

**Expected Agent Behavior:**

1. Call `get_safety_data_sheet(product_id="CHEM-2847")`
2. Call `check_hazard_class(sds_id="SDS-2847")`
3. Call `get_flash_point(sds_id="SDS-2847")`
4. Apply classification logic from SOP
5. Return: `{"classification": "Class 3", "packing_group": "II"}`

**Ground Truth:** `packing_group: II`

The agent must correctly orchestrate tools AND apply the SOP's decision logic.

## Quick Start

### Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/amazon-science/SOP-Bench.git
cd SOP-Bench
pip install -e .
```

### Configure AWS (for Bedrock models)

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your AWS credentials and model ID
```

### Run Your First Evaluation

```bash
# List available benchmarks
./sop-bench list

# Evaluate on a single task
./sop-bench evaluate content_flagging --agent function_calling --max-tasks 1

# Expected output:
# Evaluating content_flagging with function_calling agent...
# Limited to 1 tasks
# 
# Starting evaluation...
# Evaluating content_flagging ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━ 100% 0:00:16
# 
# ✓ Evaluation Complete!
# Task Success Rate: 100.0%
# Execution Completion Rate: 100.0%
# Tool Accuracy: 100.0%
```

**Understanding the Metrics:**

- **Task Success Rate (TSR)**: Percentage of tasks where the agent made the correct decision
- **Execution Completion Rate (ECR)**: Percentage of tasks that completed without errors
- **Conditional Task Success Rate (C-TSR)**: Of the tasks that completed execution, how many were accurate? This measures decision accuracy for successfully executed tasks only.
- **Tool Accuracy**: Percentage of tool calls that were correct

**Note**: TSR = ECR × C-TSR (Task Success Rate equals Execution Completion Rate times Conditional Task Success Rate)

### 5. Run Full Evaluation

```bash
# Run on all tasks and save results
./sop-bench evaluate content_flagging --agent function_calling --output results.json

# Save execution traces for debugging
./sop-bench evaluate content_flagging --agent function_calling --save-traces

# View results
./sop-bench results results.json
```

### Parallel Execution

By default, AmazonSOPBench runs evaluations **sequentially** (one task at a time). You can enable parallel execution with the `--max-workers` option to speed up your evaluations. It is recommended to start with 3 workers and can increase up to 10 if you are not getting throttled. If you get throttling exception, just decrease the number of workers in next run. 

```bash
# Default: Sequential execution (1 worker)
./sop-bench evaluate content_flagging --agent function_calling

# Run with 10 parallel workers
./sop-bench evaluate content_flagging --agent function_calling --max-workers 10

# Run with 5 parallel workers
./sop-bench evaluate content_flagging --agent function_calling --max-workers 5
```

The `--max-workers` option is also available in `batch_evaluate.py` for batch runs across multiple models:

```bash
# Batch evaluate with 4 parallel workers per model run
python batch_evaluate.py --sop dangerous_goods \
  --models "Claude Opus 4.5,Claude Sonnet 4.5,Llama 3.3 70B,OpenAI GPT-OSS 120B" \
  --agents react --max-workers 4 --save-traces
```

**Debugging with Traces:**
When using `--save-traces`, execution traces are saved to `results/{benchmark}_{agent}_traces/` for detailed debugging of agent behavior and tool calls.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**AWS Credentials**: Ensure your AWS account has Bedrock access and Claude model permissions.

```bash
# Test AWS access
aws sts get-caller-identity
aws bedrock list-foundation-models --region us-west-2
```

**Import Errors**: Make sure you're in the AmazonSOPBench directory and installed correctly.

```bash
cd /path/to/AmazonSOPBench
pip install -e . --force-reinstall
```

**Low Task Success Rate**: The framework uses automatic parser fallback (XML → JSON → Dict → Plain Text) to extract agent decisions. For best results, agents should output decisions in structured format:

```xml
<final_decision>your_decision_value</final_decision>
```

**Debugging Failed Tasks**: Use `--save-traces` to save detailed execution logs:

```bash
./sop-bench evaluate content_flagging --agent function_calling --save-traces
# Check traces in: results/content_flagging_function_calling_traces/
```

For comprehensive testing and validation, see [VALIDATION_COMMANDS.md](VALIDATION_COMMANDS.md).

## Agent Types

AmazonSOPBench provides multiple agent implementations for evaluating SOP execution:

### 1. ReAct Agent (Default - Recommended)

The default `react` agent uses LangChain's `create_react_agent` / `AgentExecutor` with automatic stop-sequence handling for all Bedrock model families. This is the agent used for all SOP-Bench experiments.

```bash
# Use the ReAct agent (default)
./sop-bench evaluate content_flagging --agent react
```

**Features:**

- ✅ Works with all model families (Claude, Llama, OpenAI, DeepSeek)
- ✅ Automatic stop-sequence handling via `StopSequenceSafeChatBedrock` wrapper
- ✅ Client-side truncation and Thought sanitization for non-Claude models
- ✅ Used for all SOP-Bench paper experiments
- ✅ Recommended for all evaluations

The ReAct agent uses a `StopSequenceSafeChatBedrock` wrapper that automatically handles stop sequences across all model families:

- **Claude**: Native stop-sequence support (no wrapper needed)
- **OpenAI GPT-OSS**: Wrapper bypasses LangChain validation, passes stop sequences through natively
- **Meta Llama/DeepSeek**: Wrapper strips stop sequences, applies client-side truncation + Thought sanitization

**Usage Examples:**

```bash
# Use with Claude models
./sop-bench evaluate content_flagging \
  --agent react \
  --model us.anthropic.claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022-v2:0

# Use with Llama models
./sop-bench evaluate dangerous_goods \
  --agent react \
  --model us.meta.llama3-3-70b-instruct-v1:0

# Use with OpenAI models
./sop-bench evaluate dangerous_goods \
  --agent react \
  --model openai.gpt-oss-120b-1:0
```

**Programmatic Usage:**

```python
from amazon_sop_bench import evaluate

# Evaluate with ReAct agent
results = evaluate(
    benchmark_name="content_flagging",
    agent_type="react",
    model_id="us.anthropic.claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022-v2:0"
)

print(f"Task Success Rate: {results['task_success_rate']:.1%}")
```

### 2. Function Calling Agent

Native function calling using Bedrock's Converse API:

```bash
./sop-bench evaluate content_flagging --agent function_calling
```

# SOP-Bench (by Amazon Science, 2026)

This benchmark was literally built to test if LLM agents can follow complex, multi-step industrial rulebooks.

- **What it is:** A benchmark of 2,000+ tasks across 12 industrial domains (e.g., Supply Chain Logistics, Aviation Safety, Content Moderation, Healthcare).
- **The "Haystack":** Every task comes with a massive, authentic human-authored Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) document. For example, a multi-page "Dangerous Goods Classification Manual."
- **The Execution:** The agent is given mock tools and APIs to investigate a specific scenario (e.g., checking a product's safety data sheet) and must output a final classification based strictly on the SOP document.

**How it validates Tri-Mem perfectly:**

- **MSA (Semantic Memory):** The 20-page "Dangerous Goods SOP" is chunked and pre-computed into your MSA layer. Your agent doesn't pay token costs to re-read it every turn, but the entropy router pulls the exact section when the agent is confused about a classification rule.
- **Visual Bus (Working Memory):** As the agent makes 15 different API calls to check flashpoints, package weights, and chemical lists, the text history gets wildly long. The Visual Bus compresses this episodic journey.
- **RAG (Declarative Memory):** Exact chemical formulas, flashpoint temperatures (e.g., "23°C"), and API keys are stored losslessly so they don't blur in the visual compression.

### 1. The MSA Layer Finally Has a Real Job

Notice this part of the directory structure they provided:

```text
benchmarks/data/your_benchmark/
├── sop.txt          # Natural language procedure
```

This is it. This is your massive, static rulebook. While their baseline `react` agent has to cram this `sop.txt` into its active prompt every single turn (wasting tokens and drowning the attention heads), your `MSAAgent` will encode `sop.txt` once into the latent prefix cache.

### 2. The Visual Bus Will Crush Their Baseline

They explicitly state that the tasks require:

> _"Sequential reasoning across 10-50+ decision points"_

Their baseline ReAct agent only scores ~55%. Why? Because by decision point 30, a standard ReAct agent is dragging 10,000 tokens of past tool calls, JSON outputs, and intermediate thoughts. It suffers from Context Rot. Your **Visual Bus** renders those 50 decision points into 4 heavily compressed image tiles, meaning your agent will stay sharp at turn 49 while their ReAct agent loses its mind.

### 3. The RAG Layer Prevents the Syntactic Action Gap

Look at the task input: `CHEM-2847`, `flash point < 23°C`, `SDS-2847`.
If you _only_ used the Visual Bus, the vision encoder would blur `CHEM-2847` into `CHEM-2841` and the tool call would fail. Your **RAG layer** extracts those exact IDs and injects them back into the active context losslessly.

### How to use this in your project

You don't even need to rewrite their evaluation loop. Because SOP-Bench supports custom agents, you just need to wrap your Tri-Mem logic to fit their interface.

1. Clone their repo into your workspace.
2. Look at their `amazon_sop_bench/agents/` directory. They have a `react` agent. You will build a `trimem_agent.py` that implements their base agent class.
3. In your `trimem_agent.py` initialization, you intercept the `sop.txt` file and load it directly into your `MSAStore`.
4. During the execution loop, your Entropy Router does exactly what you built it to do: probing, routing to MSA/Visual/RAG, and generating the next tool call.
5. Run the evaluation: `./sop-bench evaluate dangerous_goods --agent trimem`

You can now put a table in your paper showing:

- **Baseline ReAct (from their paper):** 55%
- **Tri-Mem:** [Your Score] (likely much higher, with 80% fewer active tokens).
